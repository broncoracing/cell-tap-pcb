Unsure of calibration accuracy for this test. The first segment cooled much less; this indicates that higher flow rate is required.

Start water temp: 48.4
Temp switch time: 9:51

flow rate tests: 5gal in 1:18 (14.8in^3/sec)
switched to cool water.
Flow rate tests: 5gal in 1:30 (12.8in^3/sec)
outlet water temp 25.5 30 sec after start
Water flow stop time: 9:55

End inlet water temp: 11.8C

It appears the segment wasn't calibrated well at room temperature; it thought it started the test out at 33C :(

File: candump-2024-04-06_221804.log
Starting time: 10:18
(timestamp 1712456355.978423)
Initial water temp: 47.3C
Room temp: 24.5C
Flow rate: 1:25 for 5gal (13.6in^3/s)
Switched to cool water at 10:23
(timestamp 1712456619.035202)
flow rate: 1:40 for 5gal (11.55 in^3/sec)
End time: 10:29

End water temp: 10.3C

This test went much more smoothly. The cell temperature sensors were calibrated to room temp (24C) a few minutes before the test.
